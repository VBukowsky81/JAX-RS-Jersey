Microservices, JAX-RS, Jersey

Hello, everyone.

Microservices. So much can be said about them, and how they are taking over programming world, and the internet. But it all boils down to something very simple - returning an object of data to a client, in particular format - JSON, XML, text, etc.

Now there is so much more here to discuss - architectures, standards, protocols, how to set it up in Java, etc.

I will definately find time to write more about microservices in the future.

Good day all!
